# Cdiff_in_cwCF

**Abstract**

Patients with CF (pwCF) have high antibiotic use and an altered intestinal microbiome, known risk factors for infection with *Clostridioides difficile*. However, in adults with CF, *C. difficile* infection (CDI) is uncommon and asymptomatic colonization with *C. difficile* occurs frequently, for reasons that remain unclear. We investigated the rate, risk factors, and sequelae of asymptomatic *C. difficile* colonization in children with CF (cwCF). We identified that 32% of cwCF were colonized with *C. difficile* without acute gastrointestinal symptoms. Higher BMI and exposure to specific antibiotic classes (cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and vancomycin) were significantly associated with *C. difficile* colonization. No children developed symptomatic CDI in 90-days following enrollment.
