# Cdiff_in_cwCF

**Abstract**
Patients with CF (pwCF) have high antibiotic use and an altered intestinal microbiome. They have been noted to have higher rates of intestinal *Clostridioides difficile* colonization, a common cause of hospital- and antibiotic-associated diarrhea. We investigated the rate of and risk factors for asymptomatic *C. difficile* colonization in children with CF. We identified that 32% of children with CF were asymptomatically colonized with *C. difficile*. Using multiple variable logistic regression, higher BMI and recent hospitalization were significantly associated with *C. difficile* colonization. This study advances our understanding of the gastrointestinal microbiome of pwCF.
